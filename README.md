# Costco-paperless-receipt
All we know that Costco check receipts at exit. But how to do the check with papaerless receipts? The project is the answer.
# Problem
Costco staff members check customer's receipt at his/her exiting the warehouse. Why they do that? We do not know for sure, however it is a serious obsticle to deploy paperless receipts at Costco.
# Solution
We started working with some Costco location to use paperless receipts without interrupt a checking procedure. How do we do that?
# Issue a Costco paperless receipt
When you do a check out at Costco, a cashier asks if you want a paperless receipt? If yes, then you will be asked to show a paperless receipt id. If you do not have one yet, then you can enroll for it first. When you have the id you have several options to provide it as:
1. Show a physical card and the id can be scanned
2. Show electronic form a card and the id can be scanned too
3. Use NFC form a card, so a phone can be swipe near of a terminal
Your electronic receipt id gets generated after receiving a payment and gets transferred in a phone using internet or NFC.
# Showing a receipt at exit
When you leave the warehouse and asked for a receipt, you just show your phone with a receipt QR code, or swipe a phone near NFC teminal. Costco staff member will see your receipt image with highlighting items he/she should take attention most. When a check is completed - the receipt is checked flag set to true and you can leave the warehouse.

Simple? Isn't it.
